**This project is currently a work in progress.**
It was started to give myself experience in NodeJS, specifically using Express. 

The end goal is to allow a user to create an account with a username and password, and then log in and out whenever they wish. Will likely incorporate profile pictures at some point as well.

Extremely simple in concept, since this project is intended for self-teaching.
I intend use MongoDB for account details such as Uname and Pword in the end to give myself some NoSQL experience.
